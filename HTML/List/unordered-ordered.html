                    <li>Clean the chicken thoroughly, removing any excess fat or debris.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare a breading station with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs or other coating.</li>

                </ol>
            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or pot to the appropriate temperature (usually around 350-375째F or 175-190째C).</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the breaded chicken pieces into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
                    <li>Fry the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 15-20 minutes for chicken pieces or 45-60 minutes for a whole chicken.</li>
                    <li>Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (75째C).</li>
                    <li>Remove the fried chicken from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
